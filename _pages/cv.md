I hold a PhD in Linguistics from the University of Barcelona, with a dissertation that proposed a formal analysis of *wh*-exclamatives in Catalan, co-supervised by [Xavier Villalba](https://clt.uab.cat/xavier-villalba/) (UAB) and [Louise McNally](https://www.upf.edu/web/mcnally) (UPF). Since the beginning of my career, I have been interested in semantics and its interaction with pragmatics, from formal, experimental, and comparative perspectives. This interest has led me to make significant contributions to the study of phenomena such as non-assertive sentences, the relationship between information structure and discourse (particularly in collaboration with [Laia Mayol](https://www.upf.edu/web/laia-mayol), UPF), and the semantics of modification and evaluation (especially in collaboration with [Berit Gehrke](http://www.beritgehrke.com/), Humboldt University, Berlin).

Since 2018, my research has expanded toward the study of linguistic abilities in autistic individuals and people with developmental language disorder. In this context, together with [Agustín Vicente](https://www.ikerbasque.net/es/agustin-vicente) (Ikerbasque and UPV/EHU), I founded the Language in Neurodiversity Lab ([Lindy Lab](http://www.lindy-lab.eus)), whose main goal is to gain a better understanding of the linguistic profiles and developmental trajectories of neurodiverse individuals. The Lindy Lab has explored and published research on topics such as the comprehension of non-literal language (idioms and metaphor), discourse production (both monologic and dialogic), and vocabulary acquisition, among others.

I have developed my research career at internationally recognized centers in formal linguistics, such as the Goethe Universität-Frankfurt am Main (through a contract with the Graduiertenkolleg Satzarten) and the University of Chicago (through a Beatriu de Pinós fellowship), and in Spain through a Ramón y Cajal fellowship at ILLA–CSIC (Grupo de Lingüística y Ciencia Cognitiva). Since 2015, I have been affiliated with the Department of Linguistics and Basque Studies at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) and with the Hizuntzalaritza Teorikorako Taldea (Group for Theoretical Linguistics, [HiTT](http://www.hittlinguistics.eus)), first as an Ikerbasque Research Fellow and, since 2020, as a tenured researcher (*Ikertzaile Doktore Iraunkorra*).
