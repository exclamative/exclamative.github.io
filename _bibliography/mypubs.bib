	abstract = {Previous research points to potential challenges autistic children face in constructing coherent narratives and establishing causal connections between events, although findings remain inconclusive. Furthermore, most studies focus on English-speaking children, leaving the narrative coherence skills of autistic children from other linguistic/cultural contexts underexplored. This study investigated the differences in narrative coherence between 42 autistic and 56 typically developing (TD) Spanish-speaking children matched on age (M = 8.51 years). Based on theories of rhetorical relations (RRs), which track relations between discourse units, we aimed to offer a new perspective on how coherence is achieved in children's narratives, with an emphasis on the causal RRs established. Causal RRs were coded for the specific type of RR, presence/absence of connectives, causality domain, and mention/omission of key events. Additional coherence measures included tallying the total number of RRs (causal and non-causal) and assessing narrative macrostructure through a rating scale, in line with more standard practices in the field. Results showed that, despite producing a comparable number of causal RRs, autistic children established significantly fewer causal RRs involving characters' intentions and key story events compared to TD children. Moreover, autistic children established fewer RRs overall and obtained lower macrostructure scores, suggesting lower narrative coherence levels.},

(ii) how can we explain its restricted distribution? And (iii) how does the that-clause compose with 'so'? I point out that equating 'enough' and 'so' (as has been done in the literature) is problematic, and I propose that a new approach that establishes an analogy between"so" and weak pronouns can yield satisfactory answers to questions (i)--(iii). In a nutshell, I argue that there are two 'so's: a strong (deictic) one and a weak (anaphoric) one. I concentrate on weak 'so' and show that its limited distribution has to do with the informational properties of weak items more generally. I further claim that its accompanying that-clause is not a complement of 'so', but rather an adjoined sentence that provides a bona fide focus to the sentence.},

I argue that, even if this has been challenged in the literature for Remarkably adverbs such as "surprisingly", "extremely" is a degree predicate, where degrees are not construed as positive numbers on a scale but rather as equivalence classes of individuals (Cresswell 1976). This research has interesting ramifications for the analysis of degree expressions "how" and "so" vs. "very" and "enough) and for the distinction between interrogative and exclamative clauses.},

In this paper, I focus on a few puzzles regarding the semantics and pragmatics of wh-exclamatives in Catalan and English, namely: (i) In what way is the semantics of wh-exclamatives different from the semantics of wh-interrogatives? (ii) In what way is the discourse contribution of wh-exclamatives different from the contribution of declaratives? I consider three major approaches, which I call the question approach (Guti{\'e}rrez- Rexach 1996, Zanuttini \& Portner 2003), the degree approach (Castroviejo 2006) and the non-exclamative approach (D'Avis 2002, Abels 2005). More specifically, I claim that the different pragmatic behavior of wh-interrogatives versus that of wh-exclamatives stems from differences in parameters such as speaker commitment and the contribution of intonation. Moreover, I argue that wh-exclamatives make expressive speech acts insofar as they are meaningful contributions thanks to Evaluative Intonation. Third, I propose that Evaluative Intonation composes at the Conventional Implicature tier with a set of propositions, only if they involve a linear order.},

These are wh-exclamatives in Catalan whose moved wh-phrase is headed by the determiner quin `what, which', and whose NP contains an optional DegP headed by tan `so' or m{\'e}s `more'. By taking a closer look at these wh-exclamatives, we will be able to contribute to the debate on the role of gradability and of the wh-component in the semantics of wh-exclamatives. My claim is that the DegP in these wh-exclamatives leaves behind a degree variable that is ultimately bound by an expressive speech act operator. Following Castroviejo (2006) and building on Rett (2009), I adhere to the claim that wh-exclamatives in Catalan are necessarily scalar as a requirement of the expressive operator. Moreover, as a downward-monotonic operator, I show that it licenses upward-directed inferences, which ensures that wh-exclamatives express unexpectedness toward a high degree.},

The papers in the volume contribute to an explicit and detailed account of the use, representation, and online processing of gradable and vague expressions using various kinds of controlled speaker judgment tasks, eye tracking, and ERP. The aim is to strengthen the foundations of experimental semantics and promote interaction between linguists, psycholinguists, psychologists, and philosophers who are interested in the semantics of natural language. Using data representing different languages and a variety of nominal and adjectival constructions, including degree modification and comparatives, the contributions address scale-based classifications of gradable predicates, such as the absolute vs. relative distinction; the nature of the standards for applicability of gradable expressions and the ways in which standards are determined; the nature of dimensions and multidimensionality in the meaning of scalar expressions; and the role of embodiment, subjectivity, and sociolinguistic considerations in the use and understanding of gradable expressions.}

In the current paper we aimed to test the ``Generics as Default'' (GaD) hypothesis by comparing GS and UQS in three different age ranges. Our data show that, overall, the accuracy of GS is greater than the accuracy of UQS. Moreover, we also confirm a hypothesized interaction between age and NP type (GS vs UQS). Further, we present several data points that are not predicted by the GaD, including an observed decline in the accuracy of GS in the older group of children as well as in adults, and that children fail at rejecting statements that are not considered to be true generalizations.},

We ran a forced-choice experiment where children aged 3 to 9 (N = 143) heard an ambiguous expression and had to choose the correct picture on the face of three options: one target item and two distractors. There were two counterbalanced lists, so that each critical item would be present in either the literal or the nonliteral condition. We collected accuracy data as well as reaction times. We encountered different developmental trends for LVC than for MHI, observing a literalist stage in MHI which we did not observe in LVC.},

Its main focus is on providing an account of the fact that intensification only comes about in positive polarity environments. We first entertain an analysis based on the idea that positive polarity is the result of a mismatch of meanings contributed at different dimensions, but end up supporting an alternative in which the dimensions of evaluation of the noun play a crucial role in giving rise to intensification. More specifically, intensification arises when an object is only evaluated according to one dimension. Interestingly, uni-dimensionality is not preserved under negation, which prevents intensification from arising, and, in turn, makes positive polarity an illusion.},

This makes WCQs necessarily premise conditionals in the sense of Iatridou (1991); Haegeman (2003). Along with Goebel (2017), we assume that premisehood is a speci?c use of a regular indicative conditional sentence. We explain the premise interpretation of conditionals as a combination of their thematic nature and the discourse constraints derived from the fact that p has its own discourse history. Additionally, we derive the necessary premise interpretation of WCQs from the impossibility of entertaining the question ``What happens if {\textlnot}p?'', which is necessary for the hypothetical interpretation of indicative conditionals.},

We ultimately propose that confirmational questions with oi? make a request for confirmation of the truth of the sentence anchor, whereas a confirmational with eh? is a request for the commitment of the addressee to the truth of the sentence anchor. Two consequences emerge from our analysis: oi? should be preferred when factual truths instead of opinions are conveyed, while eh? should be preferred in contexts where the speaker is not necessarily interested in finding out the truth of p. These predictions are tested in three experimental studies, which provide empirical support for the theoretical proposal regarding the different pragmatic contribution of both tags.},

Specifically, we observe that SC has not only an abilitative flavor, but also an epistemic one. Second, we want to propose an analysis for SC that can account for this ambiguity and that is in accordance with current theories of modality such as Cinque (1999), Kratzer (1981, 1991), and Hacquard (2009, 2010). In a nutshell, we argue that SC can occupy two different positions, a low one below AspP, which corresponds to the abilitative interpretation, and a high one, above AspP, which translates as the epistemic reading. Concerning the semantics, we claim that SC denotes a slight possibility; i.e., the propositional argument is true in at least one world, but it is always true in the non-ordinary worlds.}

Specifically, it aims to account for the distribution SC displays and the range of meanings it expresses in the realm of abilities, viewed as kinds of dispositions. We put forth the following~generalization: Whenever imperfective aspect interacts with SC, two possible readings arise, one that is purely abilitative and another one that expresses an accidental or unpredictable state of affairs. Our claim is that both interpretations derive from a circumstantial modal base that includes the subject's inner circumstances, albeit with a different ordering source that is brought about via the interaction of imperfective aspect and the syntax-semantics of the modal. Thus, we propose that the purely abilitative SC contains an ordering source that ranks as better worlds those in which the subject appeals to her strength of the body, intellect or character; the accidental reading is the result of covert movement of the adjective capaz `capable' over the imperfective-bearing copula ser `be', which triggers a change of ordering source in the modal.},

In this study, we focus on the prosodic properties of responses to negative statements in Spanish, a research question that has received little attention and which has not been explored in any detail. That is, we study what characterizes prosodically the following types of responses to negative statements: A: Los profesores no corrigieron los ejercicios. ‘The teachers didn’t correct the exercises.’; B1: {Sí, No}, los profesores no corrigieron los ejercicios. ‘{Yes, No}, the teachers didn’t correct the exercises.’ [agreeing response]; B2: {Sí, No}, los profesores sí corrigieron los ejercicios. ‘{Yes, No}, the teachers did correct the exercises.’ [disagreeing response]. There are two noteworthy findings. On the one hand, there is a Fall-Rise contour of the response particle (RespP, sí / no), which is observed almost exclusively in disagreeing responses. On the other hand, within the sentence following the response particle, disagreeing responses display four characteristics: (a) a longer duration of the Polarity Particle (PolP); (b) a bigger fall in F0 between the PolP and the verb; (c) a slightly higher F0 of the PolP with respect to the end of the subject; and (d) a longer duration at the end of the subject (with the RespP No). Overall, the PolP in disagreeing responses displays a substantial degree of prosodic prominence, compared to responses in agreement. Also, our results indicate that the RespP does not have an effect on the variables we investigated.}

As coined by H{\"o}hle (1992), verum focus is non-contrastive focus on the verb or a complementizer located in C in German, and it is a way of realizing the corresponding operator VERUM. In the small amount of previous literature, VERUM has been treated as a pure semantic operator. In contrast, we show that those one-dimensional treatments make the wrong predictions about the truth-conditions of an utterance involving verum focus as well as about its discourse contribution. Equipped with a multidimensional semantic framework, we treat VERUM as an expressive function that operates in the use-conditional dimension. It takes as argument a proposition p and expresses the interpretational instruction to downdate the corresponding question ?p from the question under discussion. We show that this approach to VERUM can account for the distribution of verum focus, and its discourse contribution.},

Much of the recent literature has related metaphor comprehension difficulties that autistic individuals exhibit to general linguistic abilities. In our design, we carefully pair-matched young autistic children (3.13 to 12.25 years of age) toNT controls (3.69 to 9.04 years of age) on verbal mental age and tested their metaphor interpretation abilities with a picture selection paradigm combined with eye tracking measures. We predicted differences in performance in both types of measures, although we foresaw autistic participants performing above chance in the picture selection task. However, results did not show a difference between groups in the picture selection task, which would favor accounts that relate metaphor interpretation to linguistic abilities in autistic population. Interestingly, the eye tracking observations revealed differences between groups concerning gaze movements in the region corresponding to the processing of the metaphoric vehicle. ~Such differences replicate those found in previous studies with similar designs, such as Vulchanova et al.'s (2019). On the other hand, the evidence presented and discussed in the paper does not suggest either impairment or delay with respect to metaphor processing. Rather, the evidence only suggests differences. While the source of such processing differences is still unknown, the results of the current study cast some doubts the idea that the main factor in metaphor processing in the autistic population is their structural language level.},

In a nutshell, we argue that malheureusement can take as input a set of propositions, which triggers an indifference interpretation of the sort that characterizes unconditional sentences.

Following Bonami and Godard (2008), we propose to analyze EAs as items that convey projective meaning in order to explain their peculiar semantic behavior (they cannot be directly denied, do not change the truth conditions of the proposition they evaluate, and are not factive) and their unacceptability in negative assertions. Unlike what has been claimed for many other languages, French allows EAs in questions, and we show that Catalan and Spanish do too, as long as some conditions are met. We propose an account that derives their interpretation in both assertions and questions: integrated French EAs take the proposition to their right, and if they appear in a WH-question, their interpretation is similar to that of unconditionals. In contrast, nonintegrated EAs in Catalan and Spanish have scope over a set of propositions, and are acceptable in questions only if the speaker is biased toward one of the propositions in the set denoted by the question. The acceptability of EAs in such questions, rejected by previous literature, is confirmed by an experimental study.},

Our main claim is that the felicity of a scalar implicature cancellation depends on the discourse structure. More specifically, cancellation is acceptable only if it addresses a Question Under Discussion that differs from the previous one. As will be shown, this proposal has the additional benefit of permitting us to tease apart cancellations from self-repairs.},

The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to develop a unified morpho-syntactic analysis of EAV within Hale and Keyser's (1993) approach to argument structure -- as developed in Mateu (2002) and Acedo-Matell{\'a}n and Mateu, 2011, Acedo-Matell{\'a}n and Mateu, 2013 -- and Distributed Morphology; second, to take this proposal as a basis to account for cross-dialectal variation in the productivity of EAV. We group EAV into three basic syntactic classes that share a core structure v+P. We argue that a large subset of unergative verbs must be analyzed as events with a specifier that select for a relational/predicative complement, a type of structure that is shown to underlie verbs with an adverbial argument. -Ear is further checked against unmarked -ar, the default verb-forming suffix in Iberian Spanish. We show that an underspecified analysis of EAV is compatible with cross-dialectal variation in that it accommodates the (non-)predictable range of meanings found across American varieties where -ear has become the default verbalizer.},

They raise further specific questions for syntactic categorization and category change, the nature of non-verbal semantic modality, the relationship between the syntactic subcategorization properties of the base and those of the modal adjective, or how morphological processes influence the syntactic and semantic properties of adjectives. Some of the main challenges raised by modal adjectives across different languages are reviewed, mainly (i) their modal semantics, in relation to the different root modal interpretations available in the verbal domain, suggesting a neat classification that distinguishes the various dynamic, priority and dispositional/willingness interpretations available; and (ii) their morphosyntactic properties, especially in relation to their (non)-eventive properties and the typology of -ble adjectives they give rise to.},

The aim of the study was to determine whether autistic children showed a genuinely strong tendency to interpret nonliteral uses of language literally across development. A total of 166 children (N = 42 Autistic children; N= 124 TD children) were tested using a paradigm with online (response times) and offline (picture selection) measures. Overall, there were no significant group differences on the picture selection task, but autistic children were slower in spite of increasing verbal age. Both groups showed continuous improvement of their understanding of literal and nonliteral senses with increasing verbal mental age. The results, nevertheless, call for a reflection on the (possible) literalist behavior in autism, indicating that it is important to take into account individual variation, as we observed different kinds of performance within the autistic group.},

As for language profiles in autism, three main groups are identified, namely, (i) verbal autistic individuals without structural language impairment, (ii) verbal autistic individuals with structural language impairment, and (iii) minimally verbal autistic individuals. However, this tripartite distinction hides enormous linguistic heterogeneity. Regarding the nature of language impairment in autism, there is currently no model of how language difficulties may interact with autism characteristics and with various extralinguistic cognitive abilities. Building such a model requires carefully designed explorations that address specific aspects of language and extralinguistic cognition. This should lead to a fundamental increase in our understanding of language impairment in autism, thereby paving the way for a substantial contribution to the question of how to best characterize neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the developmental trajectory for children's comprehension of evidential marking of directly perceived evidence through intonation in Majorcan Catalan (MC). Additionally, we aimed to explore children's general source monitoring abilities and their capacity to make inferences based on directly perceived information. Given that evidential comprehension tends to develop relatively late when marked morphosyntactically, we hypothesized that detecting evidential meaning through intonation would also emerge later than other types of intonational comprehension. We thus included a task to assess children's ability to distinguish between assertions and polar questions based on intonation. Data were collected through 4 tasks with a total of 97 MC-speaking children between first Preschool and second Primary school grades, along with 12 adults as a control group. Our results support the idea that source monitoring abilities develop independently from the linguistic abilities under investigation, whereas the ability to make inferences is still developing during the critical window for acquiring the distinction between assertions and polar questions, as well as for detecting intonational evidentiality. Furthermore, children succeeded in distinguishing between assertions and polar questions based on intonation well before they began performing above chance on the intonational evidentiality task, which started around age 7. This suggests that the developmental trajectory for comprehending intonational meaning depends on the specific meaning encoded by the intonational pattern.},

El ejemplo paradigm{\'a}tico de estos t{\'e}rminos es `gitano', en el que conviven un uso neutro con otro insultante que tiene el efecto de insultar doblemente: a la persona a la que se dirige el insulto y a la comunidad gitana. Mantenemos que el tipo de t{\'e}rminos que analizamos contribuye a perpetuar el racismo, el clasismo y el sexismo perpetuando estereotipos negativos, m{\'a}s que expresando actitudes.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine some basic linguistic abilities in a small sample of adults with minimal receptive vocabulary, whose receptive mental verbal age ranges from 1;2 to 3;10. In particular, we examine whether the participants in our study understand noun phrases consisting of a noun modified by an adjective. We use stimuli that they can recognise by name. Except for one participant, we find that, while all of them understand the noun and adjective in isolation, none seems to understand these noun phrases, which means that they seem to not do linguistic composition. In order to test whether the difficulty is linguistic or conceptual, we ran two other studies, one on concept composition, and the other on iconic symbolic composition (composition of pictograms). Results suggest that linguistic composition is particularly difficult in this population, and that vocabulary breadth may not predict compositional abilities.},
